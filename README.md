# Scoreboard-React-App
A simple scoreboard with stopwatch timer, built with React from a Treehouse React course I took recently. 

The app allows users to add and remove players, increment and decrement points, as well as start, stop and reset a stopwatch. 

It could be used for a quiz or something similar! I aim to build on this and add additional features as I learn more about React.
